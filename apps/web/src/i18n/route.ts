 * What the middleware does with a page request. Pure, so tests can walk every

 *
 * - `/` picks a language (a saved choice, then Accept-Language, then the
 *   visitor's country) and redirects once, for now: the next visit may pick
 *   another. A visitor who tells us nothing moves to English for good. That
 *   is what a search crawler sees, and a temporary redirect made Google index
 *   `/` in place of `/en`, against the English page's own canonical link.
 * - A URL that names a live language is served as is, never redirected.
 * - A language spelled in the wrong case moves to the right spelling.
 * - A language without a translation serves the English page at its own URL.
 * - Anything else is a page from before the site had languages, which was
 *   English, so it moves to /en for good.
